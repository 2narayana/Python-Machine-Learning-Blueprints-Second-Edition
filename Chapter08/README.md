# Python Machine Learning Blueprints, Second Edition: Chapter 8 Image Assets

Hello! This repository contains the image assets for Chapter 8: Classify Images with Convolutional Neural Networks.
 
A quick note: Depending on which version of the text you are joining us from, the outputs of the **Image-feature extraction** section may sync with either the `color_cat_burrito.jpg` or the `alternate_color_cat_burrito.jpg` image. Feel free to try them both.
 
Thanks and enjoy!
